# Project-1
Hi, my name is James Castrodad. I am 16 years old and a rising junior who attends Townsend Harris High School. I aim to learn both software and hardware aspects of technology and become fluent in various programming languages with the end goal of becoming a computer engineer. I want to attend a top-ranked university and graduate with a degree in Computer Engineering.
